      <h1>House Point Rules</h1>
      <p>
        To ensure the House Cup Challenge remains fair, transparent and
        motivating for everyone, teachers award or deduct points according to
        the guidelines below. These rules help celebrate positive actions and
        accomplishments while encouraging accountability and growth.
      </p>
      <h2>Positive Contributions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Major achievements (50–100 pts):</strong> Winning
          competitions, science fairs, debates, sports championships or
          exceptional community service.</li>
        <li><strong>Academic excellence (20–50 pts):</strong> Outstanding
          performance on exams or projects, demonstrating leadership in group
          work or tutoring peers.</li>
        <li><strong>Citizenship and service (10–30 pts):</strong> Acts of
          kindness, volunteering, mentorship, positive role‑modelling and
          contributions to school events.</li>
        <li><strong>Participation (5–15 pts):</strong> Joining house events,
          sports days, competitions, cultural activities or club meetings.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Negative Consequences</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Minor infractions (−5 pts):</strong> Tardiness, missing
          homework, lack of participation or disruptive behaviour.</li>
        <li><strong>Major infractions (−10 to −30 pts):</strong> Academic
          dishonesty, disrespectful conduct, damaging property or repeated rule
          violations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Points should be awarded or deducted fairly and promptly. Teachers are
        encouraged to provide a brief reason for each adjustment so students
        understand what behaviour is being recognised. Remember, the goal of the
        House Cup is to promote teamwork, excellence and school spirit for
        everyone!
